The bedsheets are not provided (it helps if you can bring some, or a sleeping bag, but if you can’t we can see what we can do). A few duvets are provided but it should be warm enough that you wouldn’t need it.",
      "• The bathrooms are also shared (1 main area with sinks and 4 individual toilets and 4 individual tiled boxed showers).",
      "• If you wish to stay in the gite, we will try as much as possible to organise rooms so people stay with family or at least people their own age.",
      "• If you do not wish to stay in the gite, there are several hotel options nearby (within a 10 minute drive or so). We can help you find something and/or book a room.",
      "• Anyone is also allowed to camp in the grounds of the gite (although we can only provide one 2-person tent)."
